    <p>I've been coding for around 6 years, my coding journey started in junior year of high school when I to a class about web design using HTML5, CSS, and Javascript. In my senior year, I worked on an internship at UGA Finance in Kansas City, MO, where I contributed to a variety of projects, including network setups, website redesigns, and IT support. Throughout my time at Northwest Missouri State University, I've had the opportunity to explore various programming languages and learn advance computer science topics. Some of the classes I've taken include Operating Systems, Software Engineering Principles, Database Systems, Machine Learning, and Data Structures. Along this journey, I've discovered a genuine passion for machine learning and backend development.</p>
